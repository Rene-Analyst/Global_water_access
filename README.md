Project Description: Global Water Access Analysis

Project Overview:

This project aims to analyze global water access data to uncover insights into the availability and quality of water services across different countries and regions over time. The data set includes information on national and regional water service levels, urban and rural disparities, and trends from various years. Through a series of SQL queries and visualizations, this project showcases an in-depth examination of water access, highlighting critical areas for improvement and progress in ensuring basic water services for all.

Objectives:

1.	Descriptive Analysis: Provide a summary of water access levels globally, regionally, and nationally.
2.	Trend Analysis: Track changes in water access over time to identify trends and patterns.
3.	Regional Comparison: Compare water service levels between different geographical regions.
4.	Urban vs Rural Analysis: Highlight disparities in water access between urban and rural areas.
5.	Top/Bottom Analysis: Identify countries with the highest and lowest access to basic water services.
6.	Correlation Analysis: Examine the relationship between population size and water service levels.
7.	Disparity Analysis: Measure the differences in water access levels within and between countries.
8.	Improvement Rates: Calculate annual improvement rates for basic water services.
9.	Advanced Join Analysis: Combine data from multiple years to analyze changes over specific periods.
10.	
Key Findings:

1.	Total Population Analysis: A summary of national population sizes and their water access levels.
2.	Average Water Service Levels: The average share of the population with basic, limited, unimproved, and surface water services across different regions.
3.	Trends Over Years: Visualization of how water access levels have changed over the years, highlighting improvements or declines.
4.	Regional Comparisons: Comparative analysis showing which regions have better or worse water access.
5.	Urban-Rural Disparities: Analysis of the differences in water access between urban and rural areas within countries.
6.	Top/Bottom Countries: Lists of countries with the highest and lowest access to basic water services.
7.	Correlation Between Population and Water Services: Insights into how population size impacts water service levels.
8.	Annual Improvement Rates: Identification of countries with significant improvements in water access over time
